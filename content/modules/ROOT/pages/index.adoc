SELinux is a technology to isolate processes/containers running on the
system to mitigate attacks which take advantage of privilege escalation.
Udica is a new tool which complements the containers tools (Podman,
Skopeo, Buildah, etc.) family supported by Red Hat to help improve the
security of customers container environments.

____
_NOTE:_ This lab assumes that you have a sound understanding of SELinux
basics and container fundamentals.

Prior to getting started, we need certain packages such as Udica (which
is a tool for generating SELinux policies for containers), and
setools-console (which is a set of tools that can facilitate SELinux
policy analysis). In this demo, the container runtime related packages
are already installed.

Click on the `+Terminal 1+` tab.

.Terminal 1 tab

Install the udica and setools-console packages on the container host

[source,bash]
----
dnf install -y udica setools-console
----

Get the latest RHEL9 UBI image

[source,bash]
----
podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest
----

Use `+podman+` to list the available container images

[source,bash]
----
podman images
----

....
<a href="#example_image">
 <img alt="An example image" src="../assets/podmanimages.png" />
</a>

<a href="#" class="lightbox" id="example_image">
 <img alt="An example image" src="../assets/podmanimages.png" />
</a>

Click on the `Terminal 2` tab.

Create a container runtime using podman which passes in-container accesses to /home through to the host's /home read-only, passes in-container accesses to /var/spool through to the host's /var/spool read-write, and binds the host's port 80 to pass traffic to the container's port 80.

```bash
CONTAINER=$(podman run -v /home:/home:ro -v /var/spool:/var/spool:rw -d -p 80:80 -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi)
....

____
_NOTE:_ The home directory is mounted with read-only access, and the
/var/spool/ directory is mounted with read-write access.
____

Go back to `+Terminal 1+`.

Check the status of the application container using podman and get the
running container id

[source,bash]
----
podman ps; CONTAINERID=$(podman ps | grep registry.access.redhat.com | cut -b 1-12)
----

CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES e47a11d3e2c5
registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest /bin/bash 3 seconds ago Up 2
seconds ago0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp naughty_golick

....

When using SELinux, container processes get assigned a container type called 'container_t'. In `Terminal 1` Verify the SELinux type assigned to the running container.

```bash
ps -eZ | grep container_t
....

system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c182,c1016 25755 pts/0 00:00:00 bash

....

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SELinux is enabled by default and in enforcing mode.  You can confirm this by inspecting the output of `sestatus`
on the system.

```bash
sestatus
....

SELinux status: enabled SELinuxfs mount: /sys/fs/selinux SELinux root
directory: /etc/selinux Loaded policy name: targeted Current mode:
enforcing << OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
